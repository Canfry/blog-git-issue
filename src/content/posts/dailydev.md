## Intro

I've been using Daily.dev for 2 years now and I wanted to share what it has been like for me. There are a lot of debates in tech, but one thing they all agree with is it's very important to be up to date with the latest trends, and being part of a community. And guess what, Daily.dev has those two important things.

## The start

I first used Daily.dev as a way to be up to date with the latest news in tech (framework updates, programming languages, etc...). Everything was there with the possibility to filter my feed, search by tag... Of course the reputation wasn't going high because for me it was just to read articles that interested me without the obligation to make the streak rise (and it's still not an obligation ðŸ˜€). So I had what I wanted and was looking for but with a low reputation I felt frustrated to not be able to share my articles directly on the main feed. I already had my little personal blog but I wanted to push further. And this is when the magic happened.

## Squads

At first I was scared as I didn't know who would be joining the squad, and who would be interested in my posts. But I just dived into it and started to post my articles. I shared the squad creation on Twitter and put the link to join the [squad](https://dly.to/1sJQFqpjKUq). I was very honored and surprised when I saw that Nimrod Kramer himself joined the squad. At that moment I knew that I was on the right path. It shows that it doesn't matter how small you are, you can still make an impact and get the attention from others. This is what's amazing about the squads. First you can join a squad that fits your needs and interests and try to interact with the community. And secondly, you can create your own squad and invite others to join, where you define the topics and articles you want to share. Don't wait for the others to give you what you want, create your own path and make it happen.

## Support from creators

There are a lot of good products, platforms and services out there. Most of the time you have a general welcome message and email from the CEO but you never interact with them. What surprised me a lot is the interest and attention from Nimrod Kramer and Ido Shamun to every user, feedback, comment... Of course it's just impossible to reply to everybody, but you can see right away that they care about you and want to give you the best experience possible. Only twice in my life I've received an email from a CEO saying that if I need something I can just reply to the email. And I did it, I replied asking for something and had a very quick answer. This is the type of companies, platforms, businesses... I want to be part of and try to contribute to. It just shows the hard work behind listening to users and making the product better. This kind of experience pushes you further.

## Conclusion

For the conclusion, I'm going to use the words of Yurii Rebryk the Founder and CEO of getfluently (that I just saw on LinkedIn while having a break writing this article). He talks about the mistake he made:

> I focused too much on the product and not enough on the customer.

> I assumed I knew what people wanted instead of asking them directly.

He also talked about the lesson he learned:

> Talk to users, every single day.
> Your best insights won't come from analytics.
> They come from real conversations with your customers.

It defines very well what I think how things should work and shows perfectly how Daily.dev works, and as a user (customer) we feel heard and valued.

So a very big thank you to Nimrod Kramer, Ido Shamun and all the Daily.dev Team for providing a high quality product with a huge sense of customer focus. You have all in one place, the desired content about tech and programming, communities (squads) to interact with, and a fantastic support.

I'm looking forward to seeing what's next for Daily.dev and I'm sure it will be amazing.

Thank you for reading my article.
